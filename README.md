Much of the JavaScript library is implemented in JavaScript code itself, using a minimal set of C++ runtime functions callable from JavaScript. Some of these are called using names that start with %, and using the flag "--allow-natives-syntax". Others are only called by code generated by the code generators, and are not visible in JS, even using the % syntax.

3.2.4 The Symbol Type
The Symbol primitive type corresponds to the similarly named JavaScript primitive type and represents unique tokens that may be used as keys for object properties.
3.2.9 String Literal Types
Specialized signatures (section 3.9.2.4) permit string literals to be used as types in parameter type annotations. String literal types are permitted only in that context and nowhere else.
